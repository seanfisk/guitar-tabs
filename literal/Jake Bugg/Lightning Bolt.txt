Mornin', it's another pure grey mornin'
Don't know what the day is holdin'
And I get up fightin'
When I walk right into the path of a lightning bolt

The siren of an ambulance comes howlin'
Right through the center of town and
No one blinks an eye
And I look up to the sky for the path of a lightning bolt

Met her as the angels parted for her
But she only brought me torture
But that's what happens
When it's you that's standin' in the path of a lightning bolt

Everyone I see just walks the walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta toe the line, they want the water not the wine
But when I see the signs I'll jump on that lightning bolt

And chances, people tell you not to take chances
And they tell you that there aren't any answers
And I was starting to agree
But I awoke suddenly in the path of a lightning bolt

Fortune, people talking all about fortune
Do you make it or does it just call you
In the blinking of an eye
Just another passerby in the path of a lightning bolt

Everyone I see just walks the walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta toe the line, they want the water not the wine
But when I see the signs I jump on that lightning bolt

In silence, I was lying back gazing skyward
When the moment got shattered
I remembered what she said
And then she fled in the path of a lightning bolt
