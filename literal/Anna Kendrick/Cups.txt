  I got my ticket for the long way round

  Two bottle-o-whiskey for the way
      Am         G         F

  You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
             Am            G                  F
You're gonna miss me by my hair, you're gonna miss me everywhere, oh

C
  I got my ticket for the long way round
F                               C
  The one with the prettiest of views
         Am                  G                F
It's got mountains, it's got rivers, it's got sights to give you shivers
       C             G             C
But it sure would be prettier with you

  You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
             Am            G                  F
You're gonna miss me by my walk, you're gonna miss me by my talk, oh

  You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
