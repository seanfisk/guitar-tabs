Verse 1:
G                               D
  We found your name across the chapel door
G                          C
  Carved in cursive with a table fork
G                        C
  Muddy hymnals and some boot marks where you'd
  D                        D
been
C                               D
  The shakin' preacher told the captain's man
G                           C
  The righteous suffer in a fallen land
G                                  D
  And pulled the shade to keep the crowd from peekin' in
G                             G

Verse 2:

C                               D
  We found your children by the tavern door
G                            C
  With wooden buttons and an apple core
G                           C
  Playin' house and tellin' everyone you'd
    D                       D
drowned
C                            D
  The beggin' choir told the captain's man
G                             C
  We all assume the worst the best we can
G                               D
  And for a round or two they'd gladly drag you down
G                             G

Verse 3:
C                               D
  We found you sleepin' by your lover's stone
G                       C
  A ream of paper and a telephone
G                       C
  A broken bow across a long lost
     D                  D
violin
C                             D
  Your lover's angel told the captain's man
G                          C
  It never ends the way we had it planned
G                                   D
  And kissed her palm and placed it on your dreamin'
  G
hand
