This repository contains guitar tabs written by Sean Fisk and friends. The tabs are organized into two categories, literal and interpretive. Literal tabs are as-close-as-we-can notations of the original song. Interpretive tabs are notations of our own interpretation of the song, and do not represent what we think was played in the original recording. Tabs are within their respective directory and organized by artist.
