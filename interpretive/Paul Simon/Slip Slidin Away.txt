Intro:
G   Em
G   Em

Chorus 1:
              G                  Em
Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
               G               D          C                 D      G
You know the nearer your destination the more you're slip slidin' away

Verse 1:
          Em               G
I know a man, he came from my hometown
            G               D               C           C7
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
          G                  Em
He said Dolores, I live in fear
              G              D            C        D           G
My love for you's so overpowering I'm afraid that I will disappear

Chorus 2:
              G                  Em
Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
               G               D          C                 D      G
You know the nearer your destination the more you're slip slidin' away

Verse 2:
              G               Em
And I know a woman, became a wife
               G              D          C               C7
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
             G                     Em
She said a good day ain't got no rain
             G               D                C           D              G
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed and think of things that mighta been

Chorus 3:
              G                  Em
Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
               G               D          C                 D      G   F   C   G
You know the nearer your destination the more you're slip slidin' away

Verse 3:
         Em                G
I know a father who had a son
             G                D               C                  C7
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
          G                    Em
He came a long way just to explain
              G             D               C                  D             G
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping then he turned around and headed home again

Chorus 4:
                  G                Em
He's slip slidin',   slip slidin' away
               G               D          C                 D      G   F   C   G   F   C   G
You know the nearer your destination the more you're slip slidin' away

Verse 4:
           G                   Em
God only knows, God makes his plan
          G            D               C          C7
The information's unavailable to the mortal man
              G                     Em
We're workin' our jobs, collect our pay
              G                 D               C                D       G
Believe we're glidin' down the highway when in fact we're slip slidin' away

Chorus 5:
              G                  Em
Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
               G               D          C                 D      G
You know the nearer your destination the more you're slip slidin' away
              G                  Em
Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
               G               D          C                 D      G
You know the nearer your destination the more you're slip slidin' away
