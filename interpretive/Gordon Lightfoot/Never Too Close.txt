Verse 1:

    A                  D                   A
I remember when best friends were jealous lovers
A             D                 E
  Lyin' warm asleep beneath the covers
A                D              A
  Dreamin' of belonging to each other
          D                A                E              A
And so we tried, never too close, never too near, dyin' in time
          D                    A                  E
And so we cried, but that is alright, we meant no one no harm

Verse 2:
    A                  D                 A
I remember when best friends were not mistaken
A                    D            E
  Long before that freedom was forsaken
A                        D                                A
  Learnin' about all the good things in the world worth believin'
          D                A                E              A
And so we tried, never too close, never too near, dyin' in time
          D                    A                  E
And so we cried, but that is alright, we meant no one no harm

Verse 3:
    A                   D                    A
I remember when jealous lovers would stick together
A                    D                        E
  When the days were warm and the nights more tender
A                   D                      A
  When the bonds of truth were not made to measure
          D                A                E              A
And so we tried, never too close, never too near, dyin' in time
          D                    A                  E
And so we cried, but that is alright, we meant no one no harm
D               A               E             A
Try, try as you will, followin' dreams, never fulfilled
          D                    A                  E
And so we cried, but that is alright, we meant no one no harm
