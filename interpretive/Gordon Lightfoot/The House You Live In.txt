Verse 1:
   G                      Am                         C                      G
Go first in the world, go forth with your fears, remember a price must be paid
    G                    Am                   C                             D
Be always too soon, be never too fast, at the time when all debts must be laid
   G                        C                         G                    D
Beware of the darkness, be kind to your children, remember the woman who waits
        G         Am           C          G           C            G       D            G
And the house you live in will never fall down if you pity the stranger stands at your gate


Verse 2:
            G                              Am                  C                      G
When you're caught by the gale, and you're full under sail, beware of the dangers below
          G                       Am                      C                        D
And the song that you sing should not be too sad, and be sure not to sing it too slow
     G                      C                     G                         D
Be calm in the face of all common disgraces and know what they're doin' it for
        G         Am           C          G           C            G       D            G
And the house you live in will never fall down if you pity the stranger stands at your door


Interlude:

             G                    Am                    C                   G
When you're out on the road and feelin' quite lost, consider the burden of fame
     G                   Am                  C                    D
And he who is wise will not criticize when other men fail at the game
   G                         C                      G                        D
Beware of strange faces and dark dingy places, be careful while bending the law
        G         Am           C          G           C            G       D            G
And the house you live in will never fall down if you pity the stranger stands at your door


Verse 4:
            G                         Am                C                        G
When you're down in the dumps and not ready to deal, decide what it is that you need
      G                    Am                   C                          D
Is it money or love, is it learning to live, or is it the mouth you must feed?
     G                      C                    G                     D
Be known as a man who will always be candid on questions that do not relate
        G         Am           C          G           C            G       D           G
And the house you live in will never fall down if you pity the stranger stands at the gate
        G         Am           C          G           C            G       D           G
And the house you live in will never fall down if you pity the stranger stands at the gate
